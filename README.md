## 📌 Project Overview  

The project **“Supervised Learning for City-Level IP Geolocation”** aims to predict the **city-level location** of a given IP address using **machine learning**.  
Our model learns from features such as **IP octets**, **RTT statistics**, **DNS information**, and **network-related metrics** to classify IPs by city.  

We built an **interactive Gradio dashboard** that allows users to input IPs (single, multiple, or via CSV upload) and instantly view the **predicted city** and **confidence score**.

## 🚀 Key Features  

✅ **End-to-End ML Pipeline** – from raw data → cleaned → synthesized → trained model  
✅ **Random Forest Classifier** for accurate, interpretable predictions  
✅ **Feature Engineering** – RTT stats, octets, IP class, and DNS-based features  
✅ **Gradio Dashboard** – interactive, real-time predictions with confidence visualization  
✅ **Smart Handling of Private IPs** – gracefully reports “Private IP: Location cannot be determined”  
✅ **Modular Structure** – retrainable with new features and datasets
